## Let's review

It is likely that some things won't have stuck from the last hour. To try to reinforce how things work we can work in groups to develop diagrams to illustrate Git functions and language. This should make carrying out more complicated aspects of Git clearer in our heads.

In groups:

* illustrate the concepts discussed in the first hour
* try to 'draw' what different commands mean
* try to come up with synonyms for what the commands are doing.
