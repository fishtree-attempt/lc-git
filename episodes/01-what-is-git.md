### What is Git and GitHub?

We often hear the terms *Git* and *GitHub* used interchangeably but they are slightly different things.

*Git* is one of the most widely used version control systems in the world. It is a free and open source tool used for tracking changes in computer files (primarily source code for software projects) and for coordinating work on those files among distributed groups of people. It originally came about to help software developers work collaboratively on coding projects but can be and is used for managing revisions to any file type on a computer system, including text documents.

When we make commits in a true version control system like Git, we can record a message explaining, in as much detail as we like, what changes we have made to a document or file. This makes it especially useful for collaborating. Rather than sending an email with a document with track changes and some comments, we can include all that information with the document itself. This makes it easy to get an overview of changes that have been made to a document by looking at a log of all the changes that have been made over time. And all earlier versions of the documents still remain in their original form, they are not overwritten, should we ever wish to 'roll back' to them.

*GitHub* on the other hand is a popular website for hosting and sharing Git repositories, that is to say, your group of project files. The majority of the content that GitHub hosts is open source software, though increasingly it is being used for other projects such as open access journals, blogs, and constantly updated text books. 

### Uses in a Library Context

One way to understand what Git and GitHub version control systems can do is to look at a few scenarios relevant to Library applications: 

Scenario 1: Local Librarian looking to start a crowdsourcing project

You are a local librarian looking to put thousands of historical photographs of the area online so that the community can help you identify the people and places they depict. You look at a few existing crowdsourcing projects on the web for ideas, and even though they all appear unique to each institution, they seem to have similar functionality and structure. Rather than build a whole new version from scratch yourself, you wish there was a way to just copy the code of an existing one, and modify it to reflect your project. You notice the GitHub icon at the bottom of these pages but clicking on the link just brings you to a confusing list of files and indecipherable language like "Fork".
