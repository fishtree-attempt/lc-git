### What is Git and GitHub?

We often hear the terms **_Git_** and **_GitHub_** used interchangeably but they are slightly different things.

**_Git_** is one of the most widely used version control systems in the world. It is a free and open source tool used for tracking changes in computer files (primarily source code for software projects) and for coordinating work on those files among distributed groups of people. It originally came about to help software developers work collaboratively on coding projects but can be and is used for managing revisions to any file type on a computer system, including text documents.

When we make commits in a true version control system like Git, we can record a message explaining, in as much detail as we like, what changes we have made to a document or file. This makes it especially useful for collaborating. Rather than sending an email with a document with track changes and some comments, we can include all that information with the document itself. This makes it easy to get an overview of changes that have been made to a document by looking at a log of all the changes that have been made over time. And all earlier versions of the documents still remain in their original form, they are not overwritten, should we ever wish to 'roll back' to them.

**_GitHub_** on the other hand is a popular website for hosting and sharing Git repositories, that is to say, your group of project files. The majority of the content that GitHub hosts is open source software, though increasingly it is being used for other projects such as open access journals, blogs, and constantly updated text books. 

### Uses in a Library Context

Consider these common library world scenarios: 

#### Scenario 1: Local librarian looking to start a crowdsourcing project

A local librarian is looking to put thousands of historical photographs of the area online so that the community can help identify the people and places they depict. She combs the web for examples of existing crowdsourcing projects, and even though they all appear unique to each institution, she notices quite a few seem to have almost the exact same functionality and structure. Rather than build a whole new version from scratch herself, she wishes there was a way to just copy the code of an existing one, and modify it to reflect her project. She notices the GitHub icon at the bottom of one of the projects she likes, but clicking on the link just brings her to a confusing directory of files and oddly labeled buttons such as "Fork".  

>GitHub hosts open-licensed projects...and allows any user to fork any public project. By clicking the “fork” button, any GitHub user can almost instantaneously create their own version of an existing project. That “forked” project can be used as the basis for a new project, or can be used to work out new features that can be merged back into the original.
