## How could Git and GitHub be used in libraries?

Drafts of library guides could be created and version controlled using Git. Text could be minimally marked up using Markdown to give librarians an idea of how the final version could look.

Reports such as annual reports could be drafted collaboratively and only marked up once the text has been finalised. There is no risk of valuable information being overwritten and people would always be working with the latest version.

Posters for conferences could be collaboratively produced and version controlled.

Advice on data management could be collaboratively drafted and only marked up once text has been finalised. Given the constantly changing nature of this advice, this material is a perfect candidate for version control. The collaborative nature of Git means that contributions could be many and various - even among libraries.

Blog software like [JekyllNow](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) could be deployed for event announcements.
