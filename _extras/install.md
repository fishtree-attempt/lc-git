## Install for week three

* As in week two we will want to use a laptop during this session.
* If you didn't attend week two and haven't using the command line before you will want to make sure if you are using Mac OSx and Linux you know how to get to the command line. If you are on a Windows system you will want to follow the installation instructions from week two.
* Though it isn't completely necessary, it would be helpful if you missed week two to try and understand some of the basic commands for moving between directories on the command line.

### 1. Setup a GitHub account
* If you don't already have a GitHub account set one up here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)

### 2.  Install Git
* For Windows users: make sure you followed the steps for week two then move to step 3.
* Follow the instructions for installing Git on your operating system here:
https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/.

* These instructions will install a GUI version of Git which we won't be using during the session but might be handy in the future. It will install the command line software at the same time.

### 3. Configuring your Git setup
* It will be useful to configure your github setup before we begin week three.
