If you haven't done so already, to follow this lesson you will need to:

1. Setup a GitHub account here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
2. Download and install git for your operating system: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. Configure git by opening a terminal window and entering the following commands:

~~~
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name"
$ git config --global user.email "your@email"
$ git config --global color.ui "auto"
~~~
{: .bash}

Note that the email address should be the same one you used when setting up your GitHub account.
