`>`
: redirect output. Syntax with `cat`: `cat FILENAME1 FILENAME2 > NEWFILENAME`

`rm`
: remove a file or files. NB: *USE WITH CAUTION!!!*

### Basic Git commands

`git init`
: creates a git repository

`git status`
: view the status of your files in the working directory and staging area

`git add`
: tells git to start tracking a file, or a series of files. 

`git commit`
: commits 'saves' the staged snapshot to the project history. 

`git push`
: commits the staged snapshot to the project history.

`git log`
: history of commits in reverse chronological order.

`git diff`
: shows changes made to files

`git pull`
: Merges upstream changes into your local repository 

`git remote add origin`
: add a repository where changes will be stored -
